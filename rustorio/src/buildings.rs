//! Buildings take inputs to produce outputs over time.
//!
//! To use a building, you must first build it which takes a number of resources.
//! Then you can add inputs to it using `inputs`.
//! Once it has sufficient inputs, it will start producing outputs, which can be extracted using `outputs`.
//!
//! When created, a building is set to a specific [`Recipe`](crate::recipes), which defines the inputs and outputs.
//! This can be changed using the `change_recipe` method, but only if the building is empty (no inputs or outputs).
